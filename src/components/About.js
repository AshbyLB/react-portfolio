    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm a current student of the UNCC Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp. With a background in theatre and performing
        arts, I am bringing my knowledge of entertainment into the world of development. I am seeking a job
        in front-end and back-end web development. I have a lengthy job history as a manager/supervisor of teams
        of up to 25 people.
        In my years of managerial experience, I have honed my time management
        and organizational skills, as well as developing strong communication
        skills. I look
        forward to starting my career in web development.
        Please take a moment
        to navigate through my portfolio page and feel free to contact me anytime.</p>
