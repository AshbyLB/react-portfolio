                <p>"My name is Laura Weiner, and I am a full stack web developer who was classmates with Ashby during our UNCC Coding Bootcamp cohort. During our time together, Ashby has been a vital part of my success. He is friendly and easy to work with on assignments and projects. Ashby communicates very well, takes his time to learn the material and ask questions. Most importantly, he is fun to work with!

                    He is very good at debugging problems in our codes and finds solutions that would have been challenging to solve on my own. During group discussions, Ashby takes the lead to direct the group and start working through the activity. He is always willing to share his screen and offer help to other classmates who may be struggling to grasp a concept.

                    Ashby will be a great addition to any team. He is committed to his teammates, a great problem solver and a pleasure to be around."
